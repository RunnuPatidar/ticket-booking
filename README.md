## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ticket-booking.git
Open index.html in your browser.

If you plan to integrate a backend in the future, consider setting up a Node.js/Express server with API endpoints.

🧠 Concurrency Control (Brief)
Concurrency is handled to avoid race conditions in seat booking. This typically involves backend mechanisms (e.g., atomic DB transactions), which can be added later for full functionality.

📌 Future Improvements
